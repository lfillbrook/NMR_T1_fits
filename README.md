# NMR_T1_fits
Python scripts for calculating the time-resolved T1 relaxation constants from spoiler saturation recovery NMR experiments.

SatRecT1.py
Includes the following functions:
    MonoExp - monoexponential fitting equation.
    SR_T1 - Calculates T1 values from saturation recovery experiements, using monoexponential fit.
    MovingSR_T1 - Calculate T1 values (using moving-fit approach) from saturation recovery experiements, using monoexponential fit.
